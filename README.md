# Eye Movement Exercise

##  This exercise is intended to apply the concepts around events.   Mouse events are a popular way to bind the DOM elements to events. In JavaScript, events are actions that happen on a web page. They can be anything from a mouse moving to a user typing in some text. Events happen to most elements on the DOM.  These events are a good way to bind a code to user actions. 

### To execute, simply point to the index.html file.  Once initiated, move the mouse in any direction and witness the eye movement.
